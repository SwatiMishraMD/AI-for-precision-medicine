# AI-for-precision-medicine

This paper presents a structured argument for the use of AI in making precision medicine more available and accessible. AI excels at collecting and analyzing vast data points for individual patients, allowing for highly personalized treatments. While human providers, even with technological assistance, may struggle to integrate complex information—such as genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors—AI can efficiently process these diverse data sources to deliver tailored, evidence-based care. This capability positions AI as a critical tool in overcoming the challenges of personalized medicine, improving outcomes and accessibility.
